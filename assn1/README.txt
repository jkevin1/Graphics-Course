I used no resources for this project other than the lectures, project page, and the textbook.

It seems to function properly for triangles, although it does seem slightly zoomed in (i dont know where this problem could have come from, everything seems correct)

I did have a funny error where I returned false for intersection if t<1, look at userpages.umbc.edu/~jkevin1/bug.png to see the output for tetra-1.nff.

I was tempted to add SSE optimizations for vector arithmetic, but the zoom issue was distracting.
