I didn't use any external resources for this project. It seems to work correctly although its hard to tell the height
When i tested with a simpler terrain map (4 vertices) it definitely worked
I did my best to inject my Heightmap and Camera classes into the existing code, theres probably a lot of extra variables that i didnt delete
Control change: starts with mouse grabbed, escape to release mouse, click to regrab mouse, camera only rotates if mouse is grabbed

Development platform:
Windows 10 Technical Preview 64bit
