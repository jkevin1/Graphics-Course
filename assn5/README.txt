ExtraCredit=1
Model=1
0 = terrain
1 = sphere
2 = square

I didn't use any external resources for this project. It seems to work correctly.
I did do the extra credit, change the first line value to 0/1 to turn it off/on respectively.
I also released the camera from terrain so its easier to look from a specific angle
Change the second line before running to change which model is used
